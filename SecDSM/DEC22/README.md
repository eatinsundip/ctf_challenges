We made it to December, happy holidays everyone! This is Collin's first boot2root CTF that he is is pretty excited about. Please give feedback on anything that specifically interested you or things that could be improved upon.

24 hours after the box releases or after the first solve, whichever comes last. I will release the official writeup. I do highly encourage people who finish the box, especially if it's through an unintended route, to do a writeup and submit it to the TryHackMe.com room.

There are a few ways to access the box.

1. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-a_yexduhS4QZvEC7wFUdcvUtsQtiUNV/view?usp=share_link](Download and run it locally as a VM from Google Drive.)
2. [https://tryhackme.com/jr/secdsmdecember22minictf](Run the box from TryHackMe.com through a VPN or with one of their Attack Boxes.)
3. I will be walking around the event with a USB drive holding the box. (You have to really trust me with this one).


A few more things to note.


1. There are a few easter eggs that aren't worth points but I'd love to know if you find any.
2. There are 2 flags, a user flag and a root flag.
3. The flag is in the normal "SecDSM{FLAG_HERE}" format.
4. Even if you submit the flags in TryHackMe, to be the official winner you need to check in to the #CTF channel or tweet to @SecDSM and @slash30miata on twitter to notify.

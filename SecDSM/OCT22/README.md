Craig lost the ssh password to the website again. 
It would be really cewl if you could help recover it!![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43767555/193630281-2d7863bf-204b-41d4-895a-e8e3c11cb592.png)
We backed up the shadows file with the hash
secdsm:$6$ZCSRSKjMW1h4sgDk$v2igtilkQkY5ZVFqjtoSBueSCiIaEhl6dy3ALkjwPB.s/N.tnTd6rvMDV82swKkFKHlyKUZpR4Xd5Gjb2AcqC/:19268:0:99999:7:::

We think it ended numerically, I am not totally sure because we were drinking when we set it up.

Flag is SecDSM{Cracked_Password}

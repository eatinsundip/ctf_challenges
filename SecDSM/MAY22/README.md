	<h3>The History Of Cinco De Mayo</h3>
  <p>
     Cindo De Mayo celebrates the 1862 Mexican victory over the French Empire in the Battle of Puebla.  In this heavily contrived and modern reenactment, we have collected a pcap from a French soldier.  In order to help Mexico win the battle, we must analyze the pcap for a secret message.

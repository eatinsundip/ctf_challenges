Forget crypto, help me encode in base 64 instead. 
<br>
<br>
What happens when you re-encode the encoded string... but don't stop re-encoding it?  Lets find out
<br>
<br>
https://everything.explained.today/Base64/
<br>
<br>
My challenge to you is to write a simple script in your favorite language that does only a few things:
<ul>
  <li>prints the provided input</li>
  <li>loops an encoded string or file as many times as possible without crashing</li>
  <li>outputs the string into a txt file that to see the output file size</li>
  <li>print the number of iterations it's doing</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
There are two seperate challenges involved in this:
<ul>
  <li>Get the highest number of iterations without a crash</li>
  <li>Output the largest file without a crash</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
to prove these, please provide the following to the #CTF channel on the SecDSM Slack:
<ul>
  <li>source code</li>
  <li>screenshots of the file size</li>
  <li>screenshots of the printed iteration count</li>
  <li>Video, even from a phone would be ideal.</li>
  <li>Not required but I would also love to hear your thought and challenges along the way</li>
</ul>
